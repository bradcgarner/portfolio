I noticed on mobile (iphone 8) the arrow for the first header moves to the second line. 
There is also a large gap between the Projects header and your first project. 
Also did you want the images to be side by side? 
And you might need to play with the opacity of the text in the project descriptions. When I tap on one the text on what was already open takes a little too long to fade away so I can still see it while the new text is appearing.

A _lot_ of space between “Projects” and the actual projects.
No hover states for the expandable areas.
I’m not in love with the initial expandable areas.
Visual rhythm needs some work.

Maybe something on thoughts and contributions (e.g., What The CSS project, blog posts)
Too much space to right of about

Tech stack on mobile not working
Better headshot
Gifs not sized correctly on mobile

I’d focus on giving things a little more space, 
work on hover effects and maybe tone down the tech tooltips. 
I do love the colors and the text variation.
